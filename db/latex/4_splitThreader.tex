\begin{frame}{Problem}{}		
	\begin{block}{}		
		Genomic instability is one of the \textbf{hallmarks of cancer} \cite{hanahan2011hallmarks,hastings2009mechanisms},	resulting in:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Widespread copy number changes.
			\item Structural variants.
			\item Chromosome-scale rearrangements.
		\end{itemize}			
	\end{block}	

	\begin{block}{}		
		\textbf{Copy number variants} and \textbf{gene fusions} are common drivers in cancer \cite{shlien2009copy, mitelman2007impact}.
	\end{block}	
\end{frame}
%-------------------------------------------------------
%-------------------------------------------------------


%-------------------------------------------------------
%-------------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Problem}{}
	\begin{block}{}
		The available algorithms for identifying gene fusions \textbf{do not have perfect specificity} (False positive rate). Require a joint	analysis of genomic and transcriptomic data to correctly analyze.
	\end{block}

	\begin{block}{}
		\textbf{Rearrangements variants are difficult to study}, because of the sheer complexity of rearrangements, which often include adjacencies between distant regions of a chromosome or even between unrelated chromosomes
	\end{block}
