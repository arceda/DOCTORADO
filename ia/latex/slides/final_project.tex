		\textbf{A Particle-based Method for Preserving Fluid Sheets} \cite{ando2011particle}.

		\item \textbf{Year}: 2011

\begin{frame}{Paper 1}{Problem and Proposal}
	\textbf{Problem:}	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Particle based methods are no good for simulate thin fluids features.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\textbf{Proposal:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item It is a particle-based framework that preserves thin fluid features like those in Eulerian fluid.
		\item Integrates Smoothed-Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) and Particle-In-Cell/Fluid-Implicit-Particle (PIC/FLIP).
		\item The thin sheets are preserved by inserting new particles at sparse thin points in the sheets. These particles are then quickly removed as they
		dive into the deep water.
	\end{itemize}
