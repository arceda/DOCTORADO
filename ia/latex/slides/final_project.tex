\begin{frame}{Bioinformatics}{What is Bioinformatics?}

	
	According to Luscombe et al.: \textbf{Bioinformatics} involves the technology that uses computers for storage, retrieval, manipulation, and distribution of information related to biological macromolecules such as DNA, RNA, and proteins \cite{luscombe2001bioinformatics}.

%-------------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Bioinformatics}{Bioinformatics vs Computational Biology}
	\textbf{Bioinformatics} is limited to sequence, structural, and functional analysis of genes and genomes and their corresponding products and is often considered \textbf{Computational
		molecular biology}. However, \textbf{Computational Biology} encompasses all biological areas that involve computation \cite{xiong2006essential}.

\begin{frame}{Conclusions}{}
	\begin{block}{}
		This thesis proposed the use of PSO to solve the MSA problem. The author used a set of datasets from NCBI.
	\end{block}

	\begin{block}{}
		The author proposed a mutation operator to avoid local solutions. This operator just inserts a gap.
	\end{block}

	\begin{block}{}
		The score of PSO was accepatble and very similar to CLUSTALW. Currently, there is more research on this topic.
